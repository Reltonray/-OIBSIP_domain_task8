The intercepted HTTP traffic reveals a quick sequence of normal web interaction between the local host computer (IP address 10.0.2.15) and two remote servers. The first unusual incident is at time stamp 2.441 seconds, when the local computer sends an HTTP GET request to the server at IP address 34.107.221.82 for the resource canonical.html. The request is at the application layer of communication and conforming to normal HTTP/1.1 protocol. Soon after, the server responds at 2.663 seconds with an HTTP/1.1 200 OK message, successful request, and forwards the resource in HTML data (text/html).

Following the initial HTTP transaction, the capture records two OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) requests by the host machine to 192.178.54.3 at 4.022 seconds and 4.071 seconds. OCSP is used to verify the validity of electronic certificates so that the SSL/TLS certificate for the server has not been revoked. Both requests receive instant responses from the OCSP server at 5.160 seconds and 5.180 seconds, likely confirming that the certificate is valid. They are normal checks on secure web communications, especially while accessing HTTPS resources.

Later, the local machine initiates another HTTP GET request to the same server (34.107.221.82) at 20.448 seconds, but this time requesting a file called success.txt and including a query parameter ?ipv4. This may be a connectivity test, application diagnostic, or completion acknowledgment. The server responds at 20.595 seconds with a 200 OK status and returns the file in plain text (text/plain).

Typically, the packet capture is representative of a typical sequence of web activity: an initial HTML page request, certificate verification through OCSP, and finally a plain text file download. There are no signs of failure, retransmission, or malicious activity in the traffic. The exchange is typical of ordinary clientâ€“server communication on HTTP and OCSP and representative of a typical and successful web session.
